                    <h1><a name="Why I need Redis if there is already memcachedb, Tokyo Cabinet, ...?">Why I need Redis if there is already memcachedb, Tokyo Cabinet, ...?</a></h1>Memcachedb is basically memcached done persistent. Redis is a different evolution
path in the key-value DBs, the idea is that the main advantages of key-value DBs
are retained even without a so severe loss of comfort of plain key-value DBs.
So Redis offers more features:<br/><br/><ul><li> Keys can store different data types, not just strings. Notably Lists and Sets. For example if you want to use Redis as a log storage system for different computers every computer can just <code name="code" class="python">RPUSH data to the computer_ID key</code>. Don't want to save more than 1000 log lines per computer? Just issue a <code name="code" class="python">LTRIM computer_ID 0 999</code> command to trim the list after every push.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Another example is about Sets. Imagine to build a social news site like <a href="http://reddit.com" target="_blank">Reddit</a>. Every time a user upvote a given news you can just add to the news_ID_upmods key holding a value of type SET the id of the user that did the upmodding. Sets can also be used to index things. Every key can be a tag holding a SET with the IDs of all the objects associated to this tag. Using Redis set intersection you obtain the list of IDs having all this tags at the same time.</li></ul>
<ul><li> We wrote a <a href="http://retwis.antirez.com" target="_blank">simple Twitter Clone</a> using just Redis as database. Download the source code from the download section and imagine to write it with a plain key-value DB without support for lists and sets... it's <b>much</b> harder.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Multiple DBs. Using the SELECT command the client can select different datasets. This is useful because Redis provides a MOVE atomic primitive that moves a key form a DB to another one, if the target DB already contains such a key it returns an error: this basically means a way to perform locking in distributed processing.</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>So what is Redis really about?</b> The User interface with the programmer. Redis aims to export to the programmer the right tools to model a wide range of problems. <b>Sets, Lists with O(1) push operation, lrange and ltrim, server-side fast intersection between sets, are primitives that allow to model complex problems with a key value database</b>.</li></ul>
<h1><a name="Isn't this key-value thing just hype?">Isn't this key-value thing just hype?</a></h1>I imagine key-value DBs, in the short term future, to be used like you use memory in a program, with lists, hashes, and so on. With Redis it's like this, but this special kind of memory containing your data structures is shared, atomic, persistent.<br/><br/>When we write code it is obvious, when we take data in memory, to use the most sensible data structure for the work, right? Incredibly when data is put inside a relational DB this is no longer true, and we create an absurd data model even if our need is to put data and get this data back in the same order we put it inside (an ORDER BY is required when the data should be already sorted. Strange, dont' you think?).<br/><br/>Key-value DBs bring this back at home, to create sensible data models and use the right data structures for the problem we are trying to solve.<h1><a name="Can I backup a Redis DB while the server is working?">Can I backup a Redis DB while the server is working?</a></h1>Yes you can. When Redis saves the DB it actually creates a temp file, then rename(2) that temp file name to the destination file name. So even while the server is working it is safe to save the database file just with the <i>cp</i> unix command. Btw we are working on transparent replication.<h1><a name="What's the Redis memory footprint?">What's the Redis memory footprint?</a></h1>1 Million keys with the key being the natural numbers from 0 to 999999 and the string &quot;Hello World&quot; as value use 100MB on my Intel macbook (32bit). I don't have numbers to compare the memory usage with other systems like memcached, I'll be glad if someone can provide this numbers.<h1><a name="What Redis means actually?">What Redis means actually?</a></h1>Redis means two things:
<ul><li> it's a joke on the word Redistribute (instead to use just a Relational DB redistribute your workload among Redis and a Relational DB)</li><li> it means REmote DIctionary Server</li></ul>
