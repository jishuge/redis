Welcome to Redis 1.1.95

This is the 1.1.95-beta, also known as 1.2.0 release candidate 6.

This is a minor bugfix release compared to 1.1.94 (a minor GETSET bug was fixed)
Unless major bugs are found, this is the latest release candidate.

1.2.0-stable will be relased in the first weeks of 2010 and will hopefully be
an unmodified 1.1.95 with version changed to 1.2.0.
