Redis 0.095 release notes
-------------------------

This release is a bugfix release that fixes the following issue:

 * A memory leak when passing more than 16 arguments to a command (including itself). Note that Redis-HEAD in the Git repository allows for infinite number of arguments and will deprecate the 0.09x releases.
 * A memory leak when loading compressed objects from disk is now fixed. All users should upgrade ASAP.
